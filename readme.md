'lieuwex' or 'tomsmeding'. We're happy to help with any question or issue.

Selfhosting
===
Of course you may host simplyHomework yourself, as long as you comply with the
[license](COPYING). Please do try to have at max one simplyHomework server per
school, since one of the powers of simplyHomework is social features with people
of the same school. Currently simplyHomework doesn't have social features with
people across different schools, which may be later done using a distributed
design, so that the whole problem goes away.
